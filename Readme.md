## ABOUT THE PROJECT :
<p>The name of project is “Difference between distances travelled by two cars using bar graph”.</p>
<br>
<p><b><u>Objectives:</b></u>  The aim of project is to distinguish between the distance travelled by two different cars at different time intervals using bar graph.</p>

<p><b>Platform Used:</b></p> Latest version of PyCharm (2019) is used as a platform to build python project.

<p><b>Overview:</b></p> The project is a bar graph of distance travelled by two different cars at particular time interval. 
<p><i>The project contains following modules:-</i><p>
 
 ➡️ CSV module <br>
 ➡️ Tkinter <br>
 ➡️	Matplotlib <br>
 ➡️ Pandas <br>
 ➡️ Inputs given by the user is saved in CSV files. <br>
 ➡️ User input is taken by using input () function. <br>
 ➡️	For loop is used. <br>
 ➡️	Append function is used for adding any value in list <br>
 ➡️	Class is created and under it _init_  function is defined for making a login box. <br>
 ➡️	Super keyword is used. <br>
 ➡️	A login box appears before the execution of the project to take login username and password from the user. <br>
 ➡️	The graph is saved in the form of PDF in the location provided with the use of  plt.savefig.(under matplotlib module) <br>
 <br>
 
<p><b>MODULE METHODS AND FUNCTIONS ETC THAT ARE USED TO CREATE PYTHON</b></p>
➡️<b>Matplotlib:-</b>
<p>Matplotlib is an amazing visualization library in python for 2D plots of arrays. Matplotlib is a multi-platform data visualization library buitlt on Numpy arrays and designed to work with the broader sciPy stack. It was introduced by John Hunter in year 2002. Matplotlib comes with a wide variety of plots helps to understand trende, patterns , and to make correlations. They ‘re typically instruments for reasoning about quantitative information.</p>

➡️<b>Pandas:-</b>
<p>Pandas is an open source Python Library providing high-performance data manipulation and analysis tool using its powerful data structures. The name Pandas is derived from the word Panel Data – an Econometrics from Multidimensional data.  Python  with Pandas is used in a wide range of fields including academic and commercial domains including finance , economics , statistics , analytics etc.</p>

<p>Features of Pandas:</p>
:white_check_mark: Fast and efficient DataFrame object with default and customized indexing. <br>
:white_check_mark: Tools for loading data into in – memory data objects from different file formats. <br>
:white_check_mark: 	Data alignment and integrated handling of missing data. <br>
:white_check_mark: 	Reshaping and pivoting of date sets. <br>
:white_check_mark: 	Label-based slicing, indexing and subnetting of large data sets. <br>
:white_check_mark: 	Columns from a data structure can be deleted or inserted. <br>
:white_check_mark: 	High performance merging and joining of data. <br>
:white_check_mark: 	Time series functionality. <br>
<br>

:black_square_button:	<b>CSV file:- </b>
<p>The CSV module gives the python programmer the ability to parse CSV (Comma Separated Values) files. A CSV file is a human readable text file where each line has a number of fields, separated by commas or some other delimiter. The CSV format has no standard, but they are similar enough that the CSV module will be able to read the vast majority of CSV files. You can also write CSV files using the CSV module.</p>

<br>
:black_square_button: <b>Reading from CSV file:- </b>
<p>There are two ways to read from a CSV file. You can sue the csv module’s readerfunction or you can use the DictReader class.
There are many websites that provide interesting information in CSV format.We will be using the World Health Organization’s (WHO) website to download some information on Tuberculosis.</p>
<br>

:black_square_button:  <b>Writing a CSV file:- </b>
<p>The CSV module also has two methods that you can use to write a CSV file.You can use to write a CSV file. We can use the write function or the DictWriter class.
The csvwriter function opens the path that we pass in and creates a csv writer object. The DictWriter class also support the writerows method, which we could have used instead of the loop.The CSV writer function supports this functionality.</p>

:white_check_mark:	<b>Tkinter:-</b><p>Tkinter is python module used to create simple GUI apps. It is the most commonly used </p><br>

<p>Module for GUI apps in the Python.</p>
:white_check_mark:<b>Button:-</b><p> It is used to place buttons in Tkinter.</p><br>
:white_check_mark:<b>Entry:-</b><p>  It is used to create input fields in GUI.</p><br>
:white_check_mark:<b>Frame:-</b><p>  It is used as containers in Tkinter.</p><br>
:white_check_mark:<b>Label:-</b><p>  Label is used to create a single line widgets like text, images etc.</p><br>
